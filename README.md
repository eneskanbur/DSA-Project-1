# Data Structures and Algorithms - Project #1

This repository contains the first project assignment for the Data Structures and Algorithms course.

## Project Description

This project involves performing various operations on single-linked lists for polynomials and string stacks.

### Problem 1: Polynomial Operations

In this section, various operations on two polynomials using single-linked lists are performed:

- Adding two polynomials
- Multiplying two polynomials
- Printing a polynomial
- Removing a node with a specific degree from a polynomial

### Problem 2: String Stacks

This section involves various operations on a string stack, which only allows access to the top element. Operations include pushing to the stack, popping from the stack, printing the contents of the stack, checking if the stack is a palindrome, and deleting the middle element of the stack.
